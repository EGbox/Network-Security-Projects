# Network-Security-Projects

With rising concerns of privacy and potential hijacking, I've initiated security measures for my home and business network.
The objective is to limit ads, private information, unauthorized cookies and other details at the router level to prevent nefarious actions. 
I chose NextDNS due to it's ease of use and reasonable cost for our small application (Home & Small Business)
Network traffic monitoring and anaylsis to better understand my security measures has been informative.

I have noticed less ads on multiple different applications for our nontech savvy users to be reassuring of these actions as to be working as intended.
Many social websites have an overreaching amount of data being asked from the user. The limitations imposed have been acceptable.

Known issues: Downtime has been hard to track, this may be due to the DNS provider.
