# Network-Security-Projects

With rising concerns of privacy and potential hijacking, I've initiated security measures for my home and business network.
The objective is to limit ads, private information, unauthorized cookies and other details at the router level to prevent nefarious actions. 
I chose NextDNS due to it's ease of use and reasonable cost for our small application (Home & Small Business)

I've noticed many social websites have an overreaching amount of data being asked from the user. The limitations imposed have been acceptable.

Known issues: Downtime has been hard to track, this may be due to the DNS provider.
